# Dataset entries for registry tests.  This must be loaded after base.yaml.
#
# This contains two runs with an attempt to give them an interesting degree of
# completeness and overlap (in data ID + dataset type; because they are
# different runs, they cannot actually contain any common datasets).
# In detail:
# run=imported_g:
#   bias for detectors 1-3
#   flat for detectors 2-4, physical_filter=Cam1-G
# run=imported_r:
#   bias for detectors 2-4
#   flat for detectors 1-2, physical_filter=Cam1-R1
#   flat for detectors 3-4, physical_filter=Cam1-R2
#
# At present, the path and formatter entries here are missing.  If we ever
# want to use this data for a tests that involves a datastore, that would need
# to change.
