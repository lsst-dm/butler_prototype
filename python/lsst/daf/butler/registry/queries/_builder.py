        Parameters
        ----------

            The type of datasets to search for.
        collections : `Any`
            An expression that fully or partially identifies the collections
            to search for datasets, such as a `str`, `re.Pattern`, or iterable
            thereof.  `...` can be used to return all collections. See

        isResult : `bool`, optional
            If `True` (default), include the dataset ID column in the

            on a particular `QueryBuilder` instance.
        deduplicate : `bool`, optional
            If `True` (`False` is default), only include the first match for

        Parameters
        ----------
        joinMissing : `bool`, optional
            If `True` (default), automatically join any missing dimension
            element tables (according to the categorization of the
            `QuerySummary` the builder was constructed with).  `False` should
            only be passed if the caller can independently guarantee that all
            dimension relationships are already captured in non-dimension
            tables that have been manually included in the query.

        Returns
        -------
        query : `Query`
            A `Query` object that can be executed and used to interpret result
            rows.
