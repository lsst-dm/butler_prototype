class StaticDimensionRecordStorageManager(DimensionRecordStorageManager):
    """An implementation of `DimensionRecordStorageManager` for single-layer
    `Registry` and the base layers of multi-layer `Registry`.

    This manager creates `DimensionRecordStorage` instances for all elements
    in the `DimensionUniverse` in its own `initialize` method, as part of
    static table creation, so it never needs to manage any dynamic registry
    tables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    db : `Database`
        Interface to the underlying database engine and namespace.
    records : `NamedKeyDict`
        Mapping from `DimensionElement` to `DimensionRecordStorage` for that
        element.
    universe : `DimensionUniverse`
        All known dimensions.
