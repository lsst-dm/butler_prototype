    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        Name of the dimension.
    required : `NamedValueSet` [ `Dimension` ]
        Other dimensions whose keys are part of the compound primary key for
        this dimension's (logical) table, as well as references to their own

        can't, of course), but the corresponding attribute does - it is added
        by the constructor.

        Other dimensions whose keys are included in this dimension's (logical)
        table as foreign keys.
    metadata : `NamedValueAbstractSet` [ `ddl.FieldSpec` ]
        Field specifications for all non-key fields in this dimension's table.
    cached : `bool`

        Name of another `StandardDimension` or `StandardDimensionCombination`

    expected to diverge in future changes, and the only way to make them share
    method implementations would be via multiple inheritance.  Given the

    the drawbacks (particularly the constraints it imposes on constructor
    signatures).
