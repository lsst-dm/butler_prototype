class DimensionElement:
    """A named data-organization concept that defines a label and/or metadata
    in the dimensions system.

    A `DimensionElement` instance typically corresponds to a table in the
    `Registry`; the rows in that table are represented by instances of a
    `DimensionRecord` subclass.  Most `DimensionElement` instances are
    instances of its `Dimension` subclass, which is used for elements that can
    be used as data ID keys.  The base class itself can be used for other
    dimension tables that provide metadata keyed by true dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        Name of the element.  Used as at least part of the table name, if
        the dimension in associated with a database table.
    related : `RelatedDimensions`

    metadata : iterable of `FieldSpec`
        Additional metadata fields included in this element's table.
    cached : `bool`

    viewOf : `str`, optional
        Name of another table this element's records should be drawn from.  The
        fields of this table must be a superset of the fields of the element.

    Notes
    -----
    `DimensionElement` instances should always be constructed by and retreived
    from a `DimensionUniverse`.  They are immutable after they are fully
    constructed, and should never be copied.

    Pickling a `DimensionElement` just records its name and universe;
    unpickling one actually just looks up the element via the singleton
    dictionary of all universes.  This allows pickle to be used to transfer
    elements between processes, but only when each process initializes its own
    instance of the same `DimensionUniverse`.
