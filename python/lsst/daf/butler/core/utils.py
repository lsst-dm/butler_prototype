    A class decorated as `immutable` may only set each of its attributes once;

    Notes
    -----
    Subclasses of classes marked with ``@immutable`` are also immutable.

    Because this behavior interferes with the default implementation for the
    ``pickle`` modules, `immutable` provides implementations of
    ``__getstate__`` and ``__setstate__`` that override this behavior.
    Immutable classes can then implement pickle via ``__reduce__`` or
    ``__getnewargs__``.

    Following the example of Python's built-in immutable types, such as `str`
    and `tuple`, the `immutable` decorator provides a ``__copy__``
    implementation that just returns ``self``, because there is no reason to
    actually copy an object if none of its shared owners can modify it.

    Similarly, objects that are recursively (i.e. are themselves immutable and
    have only recursively immutable attributes) should also reimplement
    ``__deepcopy__`` to return ``self``.  This is not done by the decorator, as
    it has no way of checking for recursive immutability.
